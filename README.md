# JLo's Collection of CSS Objects

This repo contains a collection of CSS objects. Full details about the objects, what they are and how they work can be found in `objects.md`.

The CSS files were the first ones created - they were later converted into LESS and SASS files to make using them easier.

## Compiling files

I've got a few super-basic gulp tasks to compile the CSS files:

- `gulp css` will compile all the CSS objects into a single style sheet.
- `gulp less` will compile the LESS files.
- `gulp sass` will compile the SASS files.
- `gulp build` will compile everything.

Once the CSS files have been compiled, you can see the `demo.html` file working which will show you the objects working.
